In this sample work, I wanted to show how I might be an asset to the CFPB web team. 
The CFPB website has some nice data visualizations; I chose one that I thought could use some improvement, and redid it. 
In this project, you'll find a screenshot of the original CFPB chart. 
It's intended as a color coded map of the US, but it doesn't actually seem like a map, as states are represented 
as identical boxes, positioned in order of the states. 
Furthermore, there is almost no interactivity in the map. 
The data is all presented statically - it is similar to a data list, 
with list items placed in color coded boxes to represent a state's location.

I downloaded the provided dataset and drew upon the legendary bl.ocks.org and Scott Murray 
to create a choropleth map of the data (screenshot included). On mouseover of a particular state, 
you can see that state's exact percentage value.
