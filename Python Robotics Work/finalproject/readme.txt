This folder contains the files for Team 30's final project. 
To predict the output coordinates of the hexbug Nano you can run the finalProject.py as follows:
 
python finalproject.py <input test file>
 
It will generate 60 output coordiantes based on running a dynamic particle filter and place it in prediction.txt.
 
This implementation requires numpy.
